# Awesome Ansible Role
This is a sample Ansible Role that generates it's README from the defaults file

## Description
This file contains default variables and settings for the Example Role. And it
is rendered into a MarkDown formatted README.md file. Hooray!

And due to the magic of scripting, it can span quite some length

Which also makes it easy to write a whole novel worth of information here.

It should also support lists! Like so:
- This
- is
- a
- list!

## Requirements
- Ansible version 2.10 or higher
- Python 3.x
- community.general
- community.crypto

## Parameters

### example_variable1
This is the first variable. It does something important.
Second line lala

Default Value: `'value1'`

### example_variable2
This is the second variable. It controls another aspect of the role.
Second line lalala

Default Value: `'value2'`

### example_variable3
This is the third variable. It affects yet another aspect of the role.
Second line lalalala
And this should also do some magic with lists:
- Isn't
- that
- cool?

Default Value: `'value3'`
